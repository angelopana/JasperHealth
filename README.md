## Jasper Take Home Assignment – DevSecOps

### Project Brief – Cloud Function
Configure and deploy a cloud function(or similar like Lambda) into any of the big 3 cloud providers. This function should be publicly available and return a basic string like “Hello World” or whatever you want. 

__Bonus:__ Deploy the function in an automated way using any tool of your choosing.

### Guidelines
- The function is configured via IaC. It could be Terraform, something else you’re more familiar with, or something you want to experiment with.
- Use either AWS, GCP, or Azure. 
- Please don’t spend more than 2-3 hours on this project.
- We ask that you complete this project within 1 week of receiving these instructions. Please reach out if you need more time.
